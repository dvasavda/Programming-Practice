# Tech Interview Preparation Repository
The goal is to understand a diverse set of problems to increase problem-solving capabilites with programming.

## Ideal Program Structure:
A personalized program can be structured as follows:

### Week 1. Arrays and Strings
- Valid Parenthesis
- Reverse Vowels in String
- Isomorphic Strings
- Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
- Median of Two Sorted Arrays

### Week 2. Binary Trees and Linked Lists
- Merge two sorted lists
- Balanced binary tree
- Palindrome linked lists
- Remove nth node from linked list
- Kth smallest element in BST


### Week 3. Dynamic Programming & Greedy Algorithms
- Climbing stairs
- Best time to buy and sell stock
- House robber
- Coin change
- Longest palindromic substring


### Week 4. Graphs and Review
- Validate BST
- Rotate Image
- Course Schedule
- Delete Node BST
- Merge Intervals


## Order of Time Complexity (Least to Most Optimal):

`O(n^2) | Quadratic Time`

`O(n log n)`

`O(n) | Linear Time`

`O(log n) | Logarithmic Time`

`O(1) | Constant Time`


## Principles to Follow:
- Do not be daunted by immediately finding the most optimal algorithm. If you cannot think of one, come up with any solution in mind and begin developing. From there - refine & optimize your solution.
- Start by reducing space complexity. Then move on to time complexity.
- Do not forget that the `for in` operator has an iteration time complexity on its own
