# Week 1 — Arrays and Strings


### Arrays and Strings are like the bread and butter of coding problems. While they are basic structures, they can easily get complicated and test you on more complex concepts.
Goal for the week: get into the ‘algorithm’ mindset and feel comfortable with basic data structures. Refresh your memory on basic concepts like recursion/binary search and handling off-by-one errors.


### It’s likely you haven’t touched on these kinds of problems for a while so this week will mostly be for you to ‘ease’ into the next few weeks of technical review.


### 5 highly suggested review questions (in order of difficulty):
```
Valid Parenthesis

Reverse Vowels in String

Isomorphic Strings

Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters

Median of Two Sorted Arrays
